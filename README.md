Opening web portals and reading headlines in a cluttered news channel is a time consuming and boring process.  
This led me to develop this app that scraps the Headlines using **BeautifulSoup4** module from Python and then using **pyttsx3** module to convert the scraped headlines into voiceover.  
The headlines are also written into a file in the root directory in case we want to read the material.

To use this app.  
1). Download the source code and install the dependencies in you local virtual environment.  
2). Double-click on the main.bat batch file and select the News Channel that you want to scrap.  
3). Enjoy the news with your cup of coffee

> *Note: At the moment the scrapper support WION and InShorts news channel.*
